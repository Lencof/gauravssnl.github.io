Hi everyone. This is my first post on this new blog. In this post, I am going to share how to print Hello World in Rust and Python. You might ask me why did I pick only these languages. They are my favorite as of now.
Please stay tuned for more updates. More articles are coming soon.

# Rust

``` rust

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World)!";
}

```

# Python

``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```

I hope you liked this article. Let me know your feedback.

Thanks,

Gaurav
