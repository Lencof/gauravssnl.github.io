Hi everyone. This is my first post on this new blog. In this post, I am going to share how to print Hello World in Rust, Python and Go programming languages. You might ask me why did I pick only these languages. They are my favorite as of now.

Please stay tuned for more updates. More articles are coming soon.

# Rust

``` rust

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World)!";
}

```

# Python

``` python
print("Hello, World!")
```

# Go

```go

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}

```
I hope you liked this article. Let me know your feedback.
