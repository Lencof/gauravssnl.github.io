Hello,everyone.Now,I would like to share a script which can be used to check whether your free sites of your simcard are working as bug for free internet. Your free sites depends upon your network. For example, 0.facebook.com may be freely accessible on your network.Then,you can use that free site as bug for free internet.

Note: To use this script, Python should be already installed on your phone.To know how to install python on Android,check my posts on my blog.

**Download: **[bug.py](http://upfile.mobi/P5AepyOl2yM)

**Steps:**

1.Download the script bug.py and edit the script as shown here(see screenshot).Use your network provider proxy & port.Squid proxies may also be used if you can connect to it.I use Squid proxy as my Simcard provider has no proxy.

2.Now, replace value of bug with your free sites which you can access free of cost.I use **ics.bsbportal.com**  as it is bug on my sim.you use your free site as bug as shown in screenshot.You can also methods of bug also.

3.Save the script file.Open Terminal application and run bug.py script. If you get Response **200 OK  **as seen in my screenshot, then it means that free homepage bug is working for your simcard.
