Hi there. I am Gaurav.

A Computer Science Engineer working as a full stack developer using Java, Spring , Hibernate and Angular at the current job. I like to learn new things and newÂ programming languages. I know Java, JavaScript, Python, Go and Rust programming languages. I am learning Rust and Go now a days. I would like to work for a company where I can enhance my skills and learn new things.


I like to build things and work on my personal open-source projects whenever I get a chance. I am also very interested in socket/network programming and related tools. I have also developed some Android apps using DroidScript & JavaScript. I used to develop Symbian S60 OS apps in Python for Nokia phones prior to that. If you want to know more about me, please have a look at my GitHub projects.


I started programming on Nokia Symbian S60 OS phones during my school days as I had no PC/laptop for a very long time . I learnt Python and PyS60 (Python for Symbian S60) to develop mobile apps. Python made me interested in programming. I joined a college to pursue Computer Science Engineering and kept on blogging, and learning new programming languages and skills.
