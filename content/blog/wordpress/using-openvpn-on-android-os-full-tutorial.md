Today,I am going to share how to use OpenVPN on Android phone.I hope this tutorial will be helpful to many who are new to this.Before that I would like to tell you all about VPN & OpenVPN .As decribed on Wikipedia:

A virtual private network also known as a VPN is a private network that extends across a public network or internet . It enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.

OpenVPN is an open-source software application that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange.

VPNs are mainly used for privacy and bypassing censorships.You can access blocked websites by using this.So,let us proceed.

**Tools Required:**

1\. O[penVPN For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blinkt.openvpn&hl=en&referrer=utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dorganic%26utm_term%3Dopenvpn&pcampaignid=APPU_14_0128V_bQEIT8vAT41YS4Ag) (available on Google Play Store)

**Steps:**

1.Download and Install OpenVPN For Android application.You can also use OpenVPNConnect but I prefer using OpenVPN For Android.\
2.Go to <http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn> and download **certificate bundle file** of any Server which you want  as shown in screenshot. Note Username & passwords also.It will be used for connecting OpenVPN later.

3.Extract downloaded file to any folder say **vpn  config** .Open OpenVPN app & export config files which you want to use by clicking on **+** icon at top and then click on "import".

4.Select any .ovpn file from that folder which you want to use for connecting VPN.Save it.

5.Now ,click on Config which you imported to connect VPN.Allow VPN permission if asked for. It will ask for username & password. Fill username and password which we got from [FreeVPN](http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn)** **earlier. Tick "Show Password" to see password & "Save Password" to save password for later use as shown in screenshot.

6.If everything is fine ,you will get connected as shown in screenshot.              **Connected: SUCCESS**

7.You need to check latest username &passwords from <http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn> .Passwords are updated everyday.

8.To ensure working of VPN,visit [whoer.net](http://whoer.net) in default web browser Google Chrome.You should see IP address of VPN server(see screenshot).you will see Hostname: xxx.vpnbook.com .It means VPN is successfully working.
