You once wrote about keeping track of comments that appeared on Facebook notes.

Well, Facebook has eliminated the note feature of Facebook. This was supposed to happen on 31 Oct. It took a few extra days.

The promise was that new notes could not be published but old notes would remain in the author's timeline.

Unfortunately, the note index of every writer has vanished. I wrote many notes, so I cannot find them again.

Is there some way to locate them chronologically?

I posted a note in the "website" box as an example.\
