**SIMPLE SERVER IN PYTHON BY InunxLABS FOR ANDROID/PC**

Thanks to **InunxLABS**  who is the  admin of gembox.us and he created this app &  I would also like to thank  **Sane4tsu** for porting the scripts to Android.

Android users have been using SIMPLE SERVER app which lacks so many features of original SIMPLE SERVER. So,I am sharing Simple Server Python Scripts for Android Users. It has all features of original SIMPLE SERVER as you all might have used on PC/Symbian.Many android users have been waiting for this.

Download: [SIMPLE SERVER SCRIPTS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zw5v7sl6mak904f/SimpleServer%5BInunxLABS%5D.zip?dl=0)

Requirements:PYTHON 2.6(along with sl4a on Android) OR Qpython App.

You can even use Qpython app(which has built-in python library and sl4a) to run this script easily. To see that post: [Click Here](https://gauravssnl.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/qpython-apprun-python-scripts/)

Steps:

1.Install Python & Sl4a.Download SimpleServer Scripts and extract all files to sdcard/sl4a/scripts/ folder or you can extract to any new custom folder.Place all files there.

2.Edit config file SimpleSever.ini as per your requirements.Save it.

3.Open Sl4a Application.

4.Click on `main.py` file and then click on TERMINAL icon(see screenshot below)

Thats all.Now you can use Inject Query tricks along with other feauters such as Custom Header Support along Front/Middle/Back Queries & several other feauters.

Thanks for reading this post.If you have any query,post in comments.
