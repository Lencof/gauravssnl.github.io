**RUN PYTHON SCRIPTS ON ANDROID EASILY*:***

Many are finding it hard to run Python Scripts (such as Simple Server  Python Script) as many don't know from where they should download Py4A(Python 4 Android) & Sl4a and how to set up those apps.Many asked me how to run Python Scripts easily so i would like to share an easy way to run Python Scripts.

Requirements: Qpython.

Steps:

1.Download and Install Qpython(not Qpython3 )  by visiting Qpython Website and then clicking on "Get QPython" or you can search it on Play Store .Downlad it from here:[Qpython Website](http://qpython.com)

Note:-Qpthon3 App is based on Python3.So download Qpython3 only if you have scripts written in Python3.Otherwise use Qpython App.

2.Now place all the files of your Python Scripts such as Simple Server to the "scripts" directory of QythonApp.Example: /.com.hipipal.qyplus/scripts/ directory

3.Open Qypthon app.Click on Python icon and then select "Run local script".Now,select the script which you want to run.Example: main.py

Now you can run python scripts easily.There's no need to install Py4a & Sl4a.Just install this app alone. It has Python library and Sl4a inbuilt.

I hope all of you liked the post.
